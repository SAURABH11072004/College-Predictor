# 🎓 College Predictor

> Predict your eligible engineering colleges in Maharashtra based on **Percentile**, **Caste Category**, and **Preferred Branch** using a dynamic, data-driven model.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**College Predictor** is an intelligent tool that helps students predict the list of engineering colleges they might get admission into based on:

- ✅ MHT-CET/JEE Percentile
- ✅ Caste/Category Reservation (e.g., OPEN, OBC, SC, ST, NT, VJNT, EWS, PWD, TFWS, etc.)
- ✅ Preferred Engineering Branch (e.g., Computer, Mechanical, IT, Civil, etc.)

Unlike static predictors, this project is **dynamic** — meaning predictions adapt over time based on:

- 📊 Number of students who appeared
- 🧠 Difficulty level of the paper (relative percentile shift)
- 🧮 Cutoff trends from current and previous years
